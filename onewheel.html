      <div class="grid-item">
      <p class="project-text">After buying my first onewheel, a onewheel pint in 2022, 
      I slowling learned that I wanted more range. The onewheel pint delivers plenty of
      torque but has a limited range of 7 miles. Onewheels with larger range, onewheel 
      XR and GT cost over $2000. To create a cheaper long range board I decided I wanted
      to purchase a used onewheel plus due to its low cost, larger size, and most 
      importantly ability to be easily modified.</p>
      </div>

      <!--First purchase and problems-->
      <div class="grid-item">
      <p class="project-text"> I found a Onewheel plus on FaceBook Marketplace for $550
      that included an extra external battery. Since it had an external battery i had no
      doubt that it's power source could be modified. I needed a Onewheel that would 
      operate as long as the controller recieved the correct voltage but did not require
      any communication between motor controller and BMS. The Onewheel plus is only the 
      second board made by Future Motion and thus did not require any communtication
      between these two devices.</p>
