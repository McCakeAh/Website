        <p>I am a student at Eastern Mennonite University pursuing my BS in Engineering. 
            At EMU I am a member of our Shell Eco Marathon team, first chair cellist of 
            the EMU Chamber Orchestra and a member of the EMU Mens Triathalon Club team.</p>
        <p>I enjoy designing and 3D printing and have two printers including one I built. 
            I enjoy building Li-ion Battery packs for various electrical devices and 
            designing custom PCB's for small electrical uses. All of these I go into 
            depth on in the projects page.</p>
        <p>This summer I am working for JZ Engineering as an intern inspecting bridges.
            Since 2015 JZ Engineering has partnered with Mennonite Disaster Service and
             West Virginia Voad to design and build residential bridges in places in need.
             My job will be to travel around West Virginia and inspect the bridges that 
             were built 5-9 years ago, specifcally looking at rust and rotting on the bridges.
