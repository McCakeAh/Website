                This has been a way to take a brake from studying for a bit and get more running miles in every
                week.

            <p class="about-text">Last year (2023) my father bought a solar buisness to start a new career in solar contracting. 
                Although a full-time student I enjoy working with my dad on jobs when ever I am home. I have helped
                install panels on our own rack mounted solar array and on other job sites. This can involve assembing 
                racking, installing pannels and hooking up power for both grid-tied and off grid systems.

            <p>Growing up on a large plot of mostly forested land has caused me to love spending time in the woods.
                This can be through hiking, camping, hamacking and fort building. To the right is a picture of 
                my brother and sister and I on a backing trip to a nearby lake with a lean to for camping.

            <img src="/images/about/maple.jpg" alt="Micaiah Maple-Syrup" class="images" style="float: Right;">
            <p>In the part of New York state the I grew up in making maple syrup was very common. In middle 
                school I found a growing desire to get involved in this industry. With my dad we built a small 
                maple evaporator to boil the sap from maple trees into maple syrup. This is a long process as 
                it takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. 
            </p>
            <p>The folling few years my dad and I grew our opperation into larger faster boiling sheds and pans 
                until we could tap nearly 500 taps and make over 70 gallons of maple syrup in one year. Pictured 
                here is a photo from our most recent year of operation.
